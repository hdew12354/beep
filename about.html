  <p class="w3-center"><em>'I am the Elon Musk of Bad Ideas'</em></p>
  <p>I love Programming, I always have done, and so I took it upon myself to try to incorperate that into the things I do, for example, when I was in high
	  school I always had trouble with understanding how electron shells worked in physics class, so I decided <i>'Screw it! let's work
	  smarter, not harder!'</i> and I made an Electron Calculator in Python!</p>

		<p>This is Me, I am Jai, but my friends call me Jaiden<sub> well technically, it's me from back in 2017-ish, but oh well.</sub> Aside from that, you probably want to know about Me! Thank you! I love to solve problems in interesting and effective ways, I love to Program and I Love to make Videos showing off my solutions to Those Problems.

		One such video can be found on my Channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hdew12354?sub_confirmation=1">GallowShot</a>, in which I set out to solve the problem of me wanting to have an Amazon Alexa, but not
		having enough money to buy one, so I decided that, since there is the Alexa App on windows, that I could use that, as well as a Steam Link to run the Alexa App on a computer, and have the Steam Link pair up with
		said laptop and a USB microphone, and run a python script I would write that actively searches the microphone's input for the word 'Alexa' or whatever I wanted it to look for, and emulate a certain Key-bind, that would
		activate the Alexa on the laptop, through the steam link, effectively building an Alexa!

      Some more about me is that i <i>Might</i> be trans!
